## Getting started

1. Generate the structure `npm run plop` and follow the instructions
2. Copy paste the kata into the relevant folders under `/excercises`
3. Profit ????

## Recommended time structure

1. First 5 - 10 mins to read and understand the Kaka
2. Either start writing test or collaborate on the overall high level implementation
3. Start with the first test case
4. Keep the last 15 minutes for retrospective or discussing different solutions if there are more than 1 team.

## Rules of engagement

1. Only a maximum of 3 people per team, more than that and it starts becoming a marketplace
2. First person only writes the first test case. You're free to discuss the implementation in a high order format but leave the technical details to the first test case.
3. Next person resolves the failing test and writes the following test. Then the round robin continues

    ```
    a(*testcase*) -> b(*implement*) -> b(*testcase*) -> c(*implement*) -> c(*testcase*) -> a(*implement*)
    ```

4. Only 2 people are allowed to talk at once. The person that wrote the test case and the person that's attempting to resolve the test case.

## Creating a forked group

1. Fork this [github](https://github.com/AndrewThian/cobra-kai-dojo)
2. Continue on your own group, if you'd like to contribute back to the original dojo, submit a PR that follows the convention - `<kata-name>-group-<no>`
